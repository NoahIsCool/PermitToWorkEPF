# Testing Process
---

## Unit Test 

Our unit test will verify the logging of equipment check-in and check-out. Upon submitting a check-in or check-out request, the test will check that a) the equipment is no longer available for check-out during the given time and b) the corresponding event on the calendar appears correctly with all the appropriate information. There will be a verification test for both the check-in/check-out tab and the calendar tab of our website, since the calendar allows drag-and-drop functionality to create reservations. 

## System Test 

Periodically tested on a test server. We are in possession of a google cloud, and a university domain. Periodically, in class, we meet and demo each of the separate features to each other. This is to minimally demonstrate functionality within the system, as well as accountability for each of the features. Most of these are on the student's machines. Continuing forward we will manage this remotely.  

## Acceptance Test 

TBD due to the virus. The project was originally to be considered completed when the website was hosted on a university server or computer and reviewed by Jimmy. The test will consist of a ‘student’ checking in and out of the EXMLGREPF on the system computer. Then the jimmy will upload a schedule and a new student roster. He will then download them both respectively and check their fidelity.
